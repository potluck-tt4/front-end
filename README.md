# front-end
In this app we created a Potluck in which a user can either signup or signin. After signing in a user can create a potluck event and post that for others to interact with. Or the user can confirm/deny that they are attending and which items they will bring. After the interaction there will be a publish of when/where the Potluck is and what is to be brought.
